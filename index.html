    <p>
      Alexandra is totally into <strong>whales</strong> because they're these huge creatures that are super chill at the same time. Every time
      she sees one, she's reminded that big doesn't mean scary or aggressive. To her, whales are like the cool, laid-back
      giants of the ocean. 🌊
